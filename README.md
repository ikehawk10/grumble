Grumble Food App

Grumble was our first bootcamp team project. This idea behind this application is to help a user identify where they want to eat. Through a series of questions - how much money they want to spend, their location, and what type of food they DON'T want to eat, I queried Zomato's API through an AJAX 'GET' request and generated those top three results with a feature image of the food, the overall rating of the restaurant, and it's location (with the Google Maps API).
